The recommended way of using this repo is to clone it into your home
directory and just run `stow DIR` on each configuration
directory. That's it! If you want to clone somewhere else then use
`stow -t ~ DIR` instead.

Of course, you'll need to have GNU Stow installed. It's a small
program you can build yourself or install it with one of the following
commands:

+ Debian-based: `# apt install stow`
+ Arch: `# pacman -S stow`
